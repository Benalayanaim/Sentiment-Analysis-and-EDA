## Sentiment Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews, followed by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the distribution and patterns of the data. The goal is to derive insights from textual data, understand customer sentiments, and present the findings through various visualizations.

## Features
Sentiment Analysis: Automatically categorizes customer reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key data metrics, including rating distribution, source distribution, day of the week distribution, and word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Interactive Dashboards: Provides an easy-to-navigate dashboard interface to explore the data and insights.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility on different devices.
